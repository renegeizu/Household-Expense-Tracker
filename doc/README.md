# Commonplace documentation

This directory contains the project documentation for Commonplace, a local-first household finance tracker. The application keeps the data in the browser using IndexedDB and avoids a backend by design.

## Start here

- [Main project README](../README.md): quick overview, app purpose, and setup commands
- [Architecture](arquitectura.md): browser boundary, data model, calculations, reports, and privacy assumptions
- [Installation and operations](guia-instalacion.md): Docker, Make targets, environment setup, and troubleshooting
- [User manual](manual-usuario.md): day-to-day usage, member management, transactions, and reporting flows
- [Technical reference](referencia-tecnica.md): implementation details, storage schema, backup logic, and export behavior

## What the app does

Commonplace helps a household:

- manage members and monthly net income
- record personal and shared expenses
- split shared costs according to income-weighted contribution
- review balances, trends, filters, and category summaries
- export PDFs and CSV reports
- keep a versioned JSON backup of the household ledger

## Design principles

- privacy first: data remains local to the browser and origin
- deterministic calculations: cent allocation is stable and reproducible
- no network dependency: there is no application server or remote API
- clear reporting: summaries and exports keep household decisions transparent

## Operating model

The project is designed for local development through Docker. Host-side Node.js is not required for the standard workflow. The Makefile wraps the most common development, test, lint, and build commands.
